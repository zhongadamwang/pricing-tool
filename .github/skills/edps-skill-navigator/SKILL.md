# EDPS Skill Navigator

An intelligent assistant that seamlessly integrates with GitHub Copilot to provide natural language navigation, discovery, and orchestration of the Evolutionary Development Process System (EDPS) skills ecosystem.

## Core Function

**Purpose**: Transform natural language requests into optimal skill invocation patterns and workflows
**Input**: User intent expressed in natural language via Copilot
**Output**: Skill recommendations, orchestrated workflows, and guided execution paths
**Integration**: Native Copilot skill that understands user context and available skill capabilities

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Skill Discovery
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Interprets user requests like "help me process requirements" or "analyze my domain model"
- **Context Awareness**: Considers project stage, available artifacts, and previous work to recommend appropriate skills
- **Capability Mapping**: Matches user intent to skill capabilities across the entire EDPS toolkit

### 2. Workflow Orchestration
- **Multi-Skill Coordination**: Sequences multiple skills for complex workflows (e.g., requirements → domain analysis → collaboration diagrams)
- **Dependency Management**: Ensures prerequisite skills are executed before dependent skills
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors workflow completion and suggests next steps

### 3. Copilot Integration Optimization
- **Natural Invocation**: Enables users to say "analyze requirements using EDPS" instead of remembering specific skill names
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation flow while invoking skills behind the scenes
- **Interactive Guidance**: Provides real-time assistance and suggestions during skill execution

## Usage Patterns

### Direct Skill Navigation
```
User: "I have requirements that need processing"
Navigator: Invokes requirements-ingest skill automatically, then suggests next steps

User: "Help me understand my domain model"
Navigator: Guides through domain-extractconcepts → domain-alignentities → domain-proposenewconcepts workflow
```

### Project Stage Recognition
```
User: "I'm starting a new project with these requirements"
Navigator: Orchestrates complete initialization workflow:
1. project-document-management (structure setup)
2. requirements-ingest (requirement processing)
3. goals-extract (objective clarification)
4. process-w5h (comprehensive analysis)
```

### Intelligent Recommendations
```
User: "What should I do next?"
Navigator: Analyzes current project state and suggests:
- Missing analysis steps
- Available next actions
- Optimal skill sequences
- Quality checkpoints
```

## EDPS Methodology Integration

### Evolutionary Development Principles
- **Iterative Refinement**: Guides users through iterative improvement cycles
- **Continuous Integration**: Ensures skills work together harmoniously
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjusts recommendations based on project evolution
- **Knowledge Accumulation**: Builds understanding progressively through skill interactions

### Process Awareness
- **Stage Recognition**: Identifies current development phase (discovery, analysis, design, implementation)
- **Transition Guidance**: Smoothly guides users between development stages
- **Quality Gates**: Ensures completeness before advancing to next phase
- **Artifact Dependencies**: Tracks and manages inter-skill dependencies

## Copilot Integration Strategies

### Natural Language Processing
```copilot-pattern
# User Intent Recognition
"analyze requirements" → requirements-ingest + goals-extract
"merge requirements" → requirements-merge
"understand domain" → domain-extractconcepts + domain-alignentities  
"create diagrams" → diagram-generatecollaboration
"create hierarchical diagrams" → diagram-generatecollaboration (--mode hierarchical) + hierarchy-management
"add boundaries to diagrams" → diagram-generatecollaboration (--mode boundary-detection)
"plan project" → plan-derivetasks + plan-estimateeffort + plan-buildschedule
"estimate effort" → plan-estimateeffort
"create tasks" → plan-derivetasks
"build schedule" → plan-buildschedule
"track project" → project-planning-tracking + process-scopemin
"track changes" → change-management
"update organization model" → orgmodel-update
"integrate models" → model-integration
"update top requirements" → process-findtopandupdate
"test integration" → integration-testing
"validate workflows" → integration-testing
"decompose process" → hierarchy-management
"generate documentation" → documentation-automation
"validate hierarchy" → hierarchy-validation
"check compliance" → edps-compliance
"analyze change impact" → change-impact-analysis
"migrate diagrams" → migration-tools
"upgrade legacy diagrams" → migration-tools
"validate compliance" → hierarchy-validation + edps-compliance
"full hierarchy workflow" → diagram-generatecollaboration → hierarchy-management → documentation-automation → hierarchy-validation → edps-compliance
```

### Conversational Flows
```copilot-interaction
User: "I need to start working on requirements analysis"
Navigator: 
1. "I'll help you with requirements analysis. First, let me set up your project structure..."
2. [Invokes project-document-management]
3. "Great! Now let's process your requirements. Please provide your requirements document..."
4. [Invokes requirements-ingest]
5. "Excellent! I've processed your requirements. Would you like me to extract goals and success criteria next?"

User: "I need to plan my project and estimate effort"
Navigator:
1. "I'll help you create a comprehensive project plan. Let me start by deriving tasks from your requirements..."
2. [Invokes plan-derivetasks]
3. "Perfect! I've identified the key tasks. Now let me estimate effort for each task..."
4. [Invokes plan-estimateeffort]
5. "Great estimates! Now I'll build a detailed schedule with dependencies..."
6. [Invokes plan-buildschedule]
7. "Your project plan is ready! Would you like me to integrate this with your organizational model?"

User: "I need to integrate new processes with our existing organizational model"
Navigator:
1. "I'll help you integrate your processes safely. Let me start by merging the process models..."
2. [Invokes process-merge]
3. "Process merge complete. Now I'll find and update top-level requirements that may be affected..."
4. [Invokes process-findtopandupdate]
5. "Updates identified. Now I'll integrate the changes into your organizational model..."
6. [Invokes model-integration]
7. "Integration complete! Let me update the organizational documentation..."
8. [Invokes orgmodel-update]
9. "Everything is updated. Would you like me to run integration tests to validate the changes?"
```

### Context-Aware Assistance
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveals relevant skills as user progresses
- **Intelligent Defaults**: Pre-configures skills based on project context
- **Error Recovery**: Guides users when skills encounter issues
