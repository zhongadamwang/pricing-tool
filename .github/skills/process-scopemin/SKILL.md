# Process Scope Minimization

Transforms comprehensive requirements into minimum viable product (MVP) scope by analyzing business value, dependencies, and implementation complexity to identify core features and establish iterative development boundaries.

## Core Function

**Input**: Requirements documents + project_id + business context
**Primary Output**: Markdown scope analysis report with MVP recommendations
**Secondary Output**: JSON format with structured scope classifications for machine processing
**Output Destination**: 
- Markdown: `outputs/projects/{project_id}/Analysis/scope-analysis.md` (primary for downstream)
- JSON: `outputs/projects/{project_id}/Analysis/scope-analysis.json` (machine processing)
**Directory Structure**: Auto-created project folders with Analysis subfolder containing scope analysis, feature prioritization matrices, and MVP roadmaps

## Usage

**GitHub Copilot Integration (Recommended):**
```markdown
Use this skill directly in Copilot by providing requirements documents.
Copilot will automatically analyze requirements to identify minimum viable scope.

Example prompt:
"Use process-scopemin skill to analyze these requirements and identify the minimum viable product scope, classifying features as core, enhancing, or optional based on business value and dependencies."
```

**Traditional Script Approach:**
```python
from process_scopemin import ScopeMinimizer

minimizer = ScopeMinimizer()
result = minimizer.analyze_scope(requirements_text, "MY-PROJECT")
# Creates: 
#   outputs/projects/MY-PROJECT/scope-analysis.md (primary)
#   outputs/projects/MY-PROJECT/scope-analysis.json (secondary)
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
python process_scopemin.py PROJECT-001 requirements.md
# Saves to: outputs/projects/PROJECT-001/
#   📄 scope-analysis.md (Markdown - for downstream skills)
#   📋 scope-analysis.json (JSON - for machine processing)
```

## Analysis Methodology

### 1. Feature Classification Algorithm

**Input Analysis**:
- Parse requirements to identify distinct features and capabilities
- Extract user stories, functional requirements, and business objectives
- Identify stakeholder priorities and constraints

**Classification Criteria**:
- **Core Features**: Essential for basic product operation, high business value, fundamental user needs
- **Enhancement Features**: Improves user experience, medium-high business value, builds on core functionality
- **Optional Features**: Nice-to-have capabilities, lower immediate business value, represents future opportunities

### 2. Business Value Assessment

**Value Scoring Approach**:
- **High Value**: Direct revenue impact, critical user workflow, competitive differentiation
- **Medium Value**: Operational efficiency, user satisfaction improvement, market positioning
- **Low Value**: Convenience features, advanced use cases, future market preparation

**Assessment Factors**:
- Revenue impact potential
- User adoption likelihood
- Competitive advantage creation
- Operational cost reduction
- Strategic market positioning

### 3. Dependency Analysis

**Dependency Types**:
- **Technical Dependencies**: Infrastructure, APIs, data models, security frameworks
- **Business Dependencies**: Regulatory requirements, partner integrations, compliance needs
- **User Dependencies**: Workflow prerequisites, training requirements, adoption prerequisites

**Dependency Impact**:
- Features with many dependencies → Consider for later phases
- Features that are dependencies for others → Prioritize for MVP
- Circular dependencies → Resolve through architectural decisions

### 4. Complexity Evaluation

**Complexity Factors**:
- **Technical Implementation**: Code complexity, integration requirements, testing needs
- **Resource Requirements**: Development time, specialized skills, infrastructure needs
- **Risk Profile**: Technical unknowns, external dependencies, change likelihood

**Complexity Scoring**:
- **High Complexity**: New technology, complex integrations, significant unknowns
- **Medium Complexity**: Standard implementation, known patterns, manageable risks
- **Low Complexity**: Well-understood technology, minimal integration, low risk

### 5. MVP Boundary Definition

**Boundary Criteria**:
- Minimum set of features that provide standalone value
- Complete user workflows from start to finish
- Sufficient functionality to validate business hypothesis
- Foundation for iterative enhancement

**Boundary Validation**:
- Can users accomplish core objectives?
- Does the product solve a complete problem?
- Is there sufficient value for market acceptance?
- Can the product sustain itself while adding features?

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase-Based Development

**Phase 0 - Foundation** (Pre-MVP):
- Core infrastructure and architecture
- Essential security and compliance frameworks
- Basic data models and APIs
- Development and deployment pipelines

**Phase 1 - MVP Launch**:

- Basic user interface and experience
- Fundamental integrations

**Phase 2 - Enhancement**:
- User experience improvements
- Additional workflows and capabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Extended integrations

**Phase 3 - Expansion**:
- Advanced features and capabilities
- Platform scaling and optimization
- New market segments and use cases
- Innovation and differentiation features

### Iterative Refinement Process

**Continuous Scope Assessment**:
- Regular review of feature priorities
- Business value re-evaluation based on market feedback
- Technical complexity updates based on implementation learning
- User feedback integration for priority adjustment

**Scope Change Management**:
- Formal process for scope additions/modifications
- Impact assessment for scope changes
- Stakeholder approval workflow
- Documentation and traceability maintenance

## Integration Points

**Collaboration Skills**:
- `domain-extractconcepts`: Domain model alignment with scope boundaries
- `domain-alignentities`: Ensure scoped features align with domain architecture
