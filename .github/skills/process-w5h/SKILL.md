# Process W5H Analysis

Transforms requirements into comprehensive W5H analysis (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) providing stakeholder identification, functional analysis, timeline extraction, context understanding, purpose clarification, and implementation approach definition.

## Core Function

**Input**: Requirements documents + project_id
**Primary Output**: Markdown W5H analysis report matching specification format
**Secondary Output**: JSON format with structured W5H elements for machine processing
**Output Destination**: 
- Markdown: `outputs/projects/{project_id}/Analysis/w5h-analysis.md` (primary for downstream)
- JSON: `outputs/projects/{project_id}/Analysis/w5h-analysis.json` (machine processing)
**Directory Structure**: Auto-created project folders with Analysis subfolder containing W5H analysis reports, stakeholder maps, and implementation guides

## Usage

**GitHub Copilot Integration (Recommended):**
```markdown
Use this skill directly in Copilot by providing requirements documents.
Copilot will automatically analyze requirements using the W5H framework.

Example prompt:
"Use process-w5h skill to analyze this requirements document and extract Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How elements with stakeholder identification and implementation approaches."
```

**Traditional Script Approach:**
```python
from process_w5h import W5HAnalyzer

analyzer = W5HAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_requirements(requirements_text, "MY-PROJECT")
# Creates: 
#   outputs/projects/MY-PROJECT/w5h-analysis.md (primary)
#   outputs/projects/MY-PROJECT/w5h-analysis.json (secondary)
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
python process_w5h.py PROJECT-001 requirements.md
# Saves to: outputs/projects/PROJECT-001/
#   📄 w5h-analysis.md (Markdown - for downstream skills)
#   📋 w5h-analysis.json (JSON - for machine processing)
```

## Output Schema

**Primary Format (Markdown)** - W5H Analysis Report:
